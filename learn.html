        <h2>Form 1 Algebra Notes</h2>
        <h3>1. Algebraic Expressions</h3>
        <p>Algebraic expressions consist of numbers, variables, and arithmetic operations. Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3x + 5</li>
            <li>4a - 7</li>
            <li>2m² + 3m - 5</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Simplifying Algebraic Expressions:</strong> Combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients. Example: 3x + 5x = 8x.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Algebraic Operations</h3>
        <p>Addition and Subtraction: Combine like terms by adding or subtracting coefficients. Example: 7x - 3x = 4x.</p>
        <p>Multiplication: Multiply coefficients and variables separately. Example: 3x × 2y = 6xy.</p>
        <p>Division: Divide coefficients and cancel common variables. Example: 8x² / 4x = 2x.</p>

        <h3>3. Linear Equations</h3>
        <p>A linear equation is an equation of the form ax + b = c. To solve it, isolate the variable by performing inverse operations. Example: 3x + 5 = 20 → x = 5.</p>

        <h3>4. Substitution</h3>
        <p>Substitution involves replacing variables with their given values to find the result. Example: Given x = 4, find the value of 3x + 7 → 19.</p>

        <h3>5. Factoring Algebraic Expressions</h3>
        <p>Factoring means expressing an algebraic expression as a product of factors. Example: x² + 5x = x(x + 5).</p>

        <h3>6. Expanding Brackets</h3>
        <p>Expanding involves multiplying each term inside the bracket by the factor outside. Example: 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6.</p>

        <h3>7. Problem Solving with Algebra</h3>
        <p>Algebra helps in solving real-world problems by forming equations. Example: The cost of 3 kg of apples at (5x + 3) per kg is 3(5x + 3) = 15x + 9.</p>
