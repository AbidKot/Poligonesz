            <h3>1. Algebraic Expressions</h3>
            <p>Algebraic expressions are mathematical phrases that can include numbers, variables, and arithmetic operations. They are used to represent real-world situations and perform calculations efficiently.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3x + 5</li>
                <li>4a - 7b</li>
                <li>2m² + 3m - 5</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Simplifying Algebraic Expressions</h4>
            <p>To simplify, combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients.</p>
            <p>Example: 3x + 5x = 8x</p>
            <h3>2. Algebraic Operations</h3>
            <p>Addition and Subtraction: Combine like terms.</p>
            <p>Multiplication: Multiply coefficients and variables separately.</p>
            <p>Division: Divide coefficients and reduce common variables.</p>
            <h3>3. Linear Equations</h3>
            <p>Linear equations have the form ax + b = c. To solve, isolate x by performing inverse operations.</p>
            <h3>4. Substitution</h3>
            <p>Replace variables with their given values to simplify expressions.</p>
            <h3>5. Factoring Algebraic Expressions</h3>
            <p>Factoring involves expressing an equation as a product of factors.</p>
            <h3>6. Expanding Brackets</h3>
            <p>Multiply every term inside the bracket by the factor outside.</p>
            <h3>7. Problem Solving with Algebra</h3>
            <p>Use algebra to model real-world problems and find solutions.</p>
